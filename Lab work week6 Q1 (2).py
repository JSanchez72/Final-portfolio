import random
for num in range(24,35):
    print(random.randint(24,35))
#In this part of the code the print from above mean the rage that the numbers will print and stop

print("randit:", random.randint(24,35))# in this other part of the code i put random so the numbers be in the rage at the same time the number will be random.
#print("randrage:",)
