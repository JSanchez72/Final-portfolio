# in this question I am trying to make a code that combines radius and pi at the end there will be a reactions
from math \
    import pi  # in this equations it shows how it started with from and is being imported to pi that is 3.14
r = float(input("the radius of the circle that gets with pi:"))
math = str(3.14 * r)# in this equeation the equation will be the pi formula with the radias of the circle that is being calculated
print("the circle with radius/pi calculated "+str(r)+"equals to:"+math)
color=input("This is the answer of the radios with pi Good Job ")
# at the end there was a compliment of the answer
