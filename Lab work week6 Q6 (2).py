# in the last question is making two responces that make the same answer from calculating the factorial
num=int(input("Enter Number for answer of factorial:"))
fact=1# in this part the factorial make it a loop to keep going until finish. also the fact=1 when increase it doubles
for numbers in range(1,num++1):# this equation is being printed as a loop that make the number show every
    fact=fact*numbers# fact means factorial
    print(num,"is the factorial number of",fact)# in this part is when the equation combines to out put the answer
    #This part of the equation is using for loop to see every convination that uses loop

import math
number=int(input(" Enter the factorial Number for answer is="))# In this equation I use the math dodule to find the singular equation
print("number for the factorial of number is equal to ",(number,math.factorial(number)))
# at the end it will print the singular answer from the equation
# this last code is a place holder to stop any loop
