#In this questions we are going to try and solve for print the numbers with the square next to each other

nums=[12,10,32,3,66,17,42,99,20]# in the top will print the numbers that were made
for n in nums:
    print(n)#in this part of the code it will have the numbers next to the numbers that are sqr
    sqr=n*n
    squared=(sqr)
    print("the square of the number",n, "is" ,squared)
# at the end it will print the number with sentece with the sqr
