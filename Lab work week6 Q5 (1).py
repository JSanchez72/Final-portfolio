# in this question we are trying to solve how to inport two numbers and find the pythagorean theorem
import math
pow(5,10,3)# the fist thing is print import math that will be a math problome
side=5
side=3
Side=10# then have two point numbers to have a calculation to a whole of the shape
#with the sqrt it will calculate the two number and give you a answer
shape=math.sqrt(side**5+side**10+side**3)
print("the calculation shape of the pytharium theorem is ", shape)
# at the end it will give the answer with a short responce of the work
